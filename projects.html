				<h3>Bright Steps</h3>
				<p>Raising a child with a developmental disability can be stressful. Families often don't even know where to start. Things get dicey when you add financial complications to the mix. Unfortunately for Down syndrome, the child has about a 6-year window to grasp fundamentals like speech, walking, cognition, social skills, and toilet training. Since every child is different, these milestones may need guidance from specialized pediatricians and physiotherapists, and sometimes, the bills get out of control. In these challenging times, let us bring you an AI-driven solution that you can trust. Get quality therapy sessions and guidance that is tailored specifically for your child.</p>
